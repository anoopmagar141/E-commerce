            <h2>Acknowledgement</h2>
            <p>We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to our subject teacher, Ms. Pushpa Rai, for assigning us this insightful project on Nepali e-commerce websites. Her guidance and clear instructions have been instrumental in helping us understand the fundamental aspects of online businesses, including business models, payment systems, customer service, and website evaluation.</p>
            <p>We extend our sincere appreciation to our team members -- Anup Magar, Aayushman Rai, Aditya Koirala, and Mausam Ban -- for their dedication, teamwork, and contributions in researching, analyzing, and compiling this report. The journey of working together has been both educational and enjoyable, allowing us to develop not just our analytical skills but also our ability to collaborate effectively.</p>
            <p>We also acknowledge the vast resources available online, including articles, blogs, user reviews, and other digital materials, which provided us with valuable insights into eSewa and Daraz. Additionally, we appreciate the customer service representatives of these platforms, whose responses helped us better understand their services and policies.</p>
            <p>Throughout this project, we faced challenges such as filtering credible information from vast online sources and ensuring an unbiased evaluation. However, overcoming these difficulties strengthened our research skills and deepened our understanding of Nepal's growing e-commerce landscape. More importantly, we had a great time working together, sharing ideas, and learning from each other. This project not only enhanced our knowledge but also reinforced the importance of teamwork, time management, and critical thinking.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we are thankful to our friends and family for their encouragement and support throughout this project.</p>
            <p>Thank you.</p>
